Le nouveau ""tenementier"" du bief d'Etoz était le fils aîné du ""mécanicien"" qui avait obtenu le droit des moulins en ce lieu-dit, Jacques Rondot (1620-1701) époux de Marie-Catherine Mougin (1635-1705) ; il était devenu propriétaire, au titre d'acensement perpétuel, des moulins banaux du ""Bief d'Etoz sous Charmauvillers"" : cela représentait un ensemble constitué par trois moulins à grains,deux ribbes, une foule et une huilerie. Les moulins Rondot se trouvaient vis-à-vis des moulins Folletête, en territoire français, en bordure du petit lac que formaient les eaux de la rivière, assagies après la traversée de ""la Goule"".
Une chapelle votive est édifiée en 1694 au Bief d'Etoz à la suite d'un voeu : le ""tenementier"" des moulins du Bief, Jacques Rondot ayant été désarçonné par le cheval qu'il montait et projeté au bas d'un rocher sur la côte, avait promis, s'il échappait aux conséquences de cet accident, de bâtir une chapelle en l'honneur de N.D. des Ermites, au voisinage de sa résidence. Dotée d'un patrimoine, en 1694, cette chapelle fut pourvue d'un chatelain jusqu'à la Révolution ; le clocheton de la chapelle renferme deux cloches : l'une de 1695 (diamètre 44 cm, note sol) l'autre de 1739 (diamètre 40 cm, note la) cette dernière offerte par les maîtres-verriers : Melchior et Michel Graizely de la verrerie des Essarts-Cuenot.",,,,,,,"RONDOT","Jacques",17010609,"Charmauvillers","Jacques",,,810609,0,

C'est en 1613 que ce mécanicien avait obtenu l'acensement du moulin et de la forge du ""Bief d'Etoz"". Il y avait alors 60 habitants sur le territoire de la communauté de Charmauvillers. Mais la guerre de Trente Ans n'allait pas tarder à sévir sur le territoire bourguignon, engendrant sur ce petit coin du comté de Bourgogne tout ce que les hostilités peuvent apporter : fer et feu, destructions accrues par la famine et la peste.

Membre de la Résistance, réseau BUCKMASTER ALEXANDRE, agent de renseignement, il est arreté le 12 septembre 1943, peu avant 6 heures du matin, par la milice française au ordre du franciste Marcel Bucard, après infiltration du réseau par un traite, et livré à la gestapo.
Enfermé à la prison Lafayette à Nantes, il est interrogé. Transféré à Compiègne au camp Royallieu, il est déporté au camp de Buchenwald, entassé à 110 pendant deux jours dans un wagon à bestiaux, où il arrive le 16 janvier 1944. Matricule 4.1112
Sa carte de déporté résistant indique : interné du 12/9/43 au 15/1/44, déporté du 16/1/44/ au 27/4/45, motif : dépot de munitions. (cachées dans son jardin). Il y restera jusqu'au 11 avril 45. 
Dans ce combat de tout les jours pour la vie, des hommes trouvent des espaces de liberté où l'amitié, la solidarité, leur permettent de garder espoir. Ces espaces se nomment aussi la Foi. Un prisonnier français qui travaillait à l'usine d'armement de Weimar réussit à parles à un ouvrier allemand. Peu à peu, il lui exprime le désir de l'aumonier clandestin, l'abbé BLANC, et de quelques camarades , de pouvoir communier. Au rique de sa vie, cet ouvrier, en relation avec un prêtre cotholique allemand,leur passe des hosties consacrées. ... C'est ainsi que chaque mois il reçoit une hostie dans cet enfer de Buchenwald. "" Je cachais le Bon Dieu sur moi dans un papier blanc, confie-t-il à sa fille. Je communiais chaque semaine avec une parcelle. Je gardais précieusement les miettes pour me communier une cinquième fois."" Le 11 avril, c'était mon anniversaire : 47 ans ; je communie en disant au Bon Dieu : ma femme ne pourra pas me faire de cadeau, Vous m'en faites un en m'accordant de ne pas partir sur les routes ... sinon je meurs. En effet j'avais très peur de partir sur les routes. Les SS commençaient à évacuer le camp à l'approche des troupes alliées. J'étais tellement faible que je n'aurais pas pu suivre et les SS abattaient tous ceux qui tombaient. Et le 41112 sort... Je ne voulais pas partir. Je me faufile dans un blockhaus espèrant ne pas être vu.. mais un SS me pousuit avec un bâton. - Raus ! (sors). Perdu pour perdu, je me précipite dehors. Au moment de passer la porte, le bâton du soldat au lieu de s'abattre sur moi, heurte le haut de l'encadrement, ce qui empêche le coup. J'étais sorti. Il me rattrape et me frappe derrière la tête. Je tombe. Sans doute a-t-il cru que c'était fini pour moi ! Je ne l'ai pas revu et je me suis caché.""
""Les prisonniers qui travaillaient à l'usine de Weimar apportaient, en les dissimulant, des parties de fusils ou d'autres armes. Après avoir creusé une galerie sous le blockhaus, ils constituent un petit arsenal. Ces travailleurs sont surtout des communistes.Les derniers jours il reste relativement peu de SS pour garder le camp. Lorsque le drapeau blanc flotte sur l'église de Weimar, les prisonniers se précipitent dans leur galerie-dépot. Ils sortent les armes; ils délivrent le camp. C'est une belle victoire ! C'est le 11 avril 1945."" Les américains prennent ensuite  possession du camp.
Le 30 avril il arrive à Nantes mais ne peut rentrer à Saint-Père que le 13 mai, la poche de St Nazaire étant toujours tenue par les allemands.( La reddition allemande n'a eu lieu que le 11 mai à Bouvron entre le général américain Kraemer et le général allemand Juck )
Déportés avec 3 autres résistants de Saint-Père, il sera le seul à revenir. En leur honneur une stèle où sont gravés les noms de ces quatre valeureux combatants à été inaugurée à Saint-Père-en-Retz le 10 mai 1992.

D'après Fouquet, Hommes célèbres et personnalités marquantes de Franche-Comté :
Missionnaire français, né au Russey (Doubs) en 1665, mort à Tchang-Fou, près de Pékin en 1741.
En 1665, il entra au noviciat d'Avignon et, le 16 mars 1698, s'embarqua à La Rochelle pour Canton. Ayant compris le chinois et la langue tartare-mandchou, il ne tarda pas à acquérir une grande influence sur l'empereur Kang-Hi dont il devint le conseiller.
Dominique Parenin vécut en Chine 43 années dont il consacra la moitié à l'étude des langues, des moeurs et des coutumes. C'est seulement vers 1723 que, dans sa correspondance à l'Académie des Sciences, il commença à communiquer au monde savant le fruit de ses observations et de donner sur les moeurs chinoises d'intéressants et précieux renseignements qui furent utilisés par plusieurs écrivains, notamment par Voltaire. Parenin qui avait toute la confiance de l'empereur de Chine, accomplit plusieurs missions diplomatiques. Les plus ingrates furent celles qu'il eut à remplir à l'occasion des ambassades déléguées en Chine par le Souverain Pontife, l'une en 1705, l'autre en 1720. En 1727, il eut aussi à introduire l'ambassadeur du Portugal et la même année, il fut député à la conférence sino-russe qui devait se terminer par le traité de Kiakhra. Le 27 septembre 1741, Parenin mourut épuisé par une maladie implacable qui le minait depuis trois ans. L'empereur le fit enterrer à ses frais avec grands honneurs. Une stèle encastrée dans le mur du petit cimetière de Tcheng-Fou rappelle le souvenir du savant missionnaire qui fut un des meilleurs serviteurs de la France en Extrême-Orient. (V. l'ouvrage de Jean Bouchot sur Dominique Parenin, Editions A. Nachbaur, Pékin). Le P. Parenin a sa statue au Russey.

<br>
<br>d'après Christian Monneret (Racines n°16545) :
<br>""Antoine Bouhélier semble être né vers 1591, d'après un témoignage qu'il fait dans une enquête de 1644 où il dit avoir 53 ans. Il y a sans doute plusieurs Antoine Bouhélier contemporains, mais il dit qu'il habitait avant ""le Vaudey"" et qu'ensuite il s'est fait habitant à Charquemont (archives du baillage de Baume, BBP8974) ce qui correspond bien à cet Antoine Bouhélie.
<br>Il est mort peu avant 1661, car en 1673, Nicolas Regnier mari de Françoise Bouhelier et George Jean Clerc mari de Anne Bouhelier font un compte ensemble dans lequel ils rappellent le partage des biens de furent Antoine Bouhélier et Marguerite Chatelain Maisonette fait le 5 nov 1662 par devant Maillot notaire (3E63,66 fol°79).""",,"Décédé vers 1636 d'après le site généalogique de Alice Damien (GeneaNet/682).",,,"0",,"BOUHELIER","Antoine",16610000,"Charquemont","Antoine",,,700000,0,

Testament de Richard GUENIN maire de la Franche Montagne des Bois. 
<br>
Au nom de la sainte et indinidne Trinité du Père du Fils et Benoît Saint Esprit. Je Richard Guénin, maire en la Franche Montagne des bois, combien que je sois infirme de mon corps sain néanmoins de sens de pensée et d'entendement, réduisant en moi qu'il n'y a rien de plus certain que la mort et rien de plus incertain que l'heure d'icelle, j'ai fait et conduit mon testament nucupatif et ordonnance de dernière volonté le plus valable se faire se peut en la forme et manière suivante: Premièrement, quand mon âme partira de mon corps, je la rends et recommande à Dieu mon souverain Créateur, le priant de devouloir la recevoir en son saint royaume de paradis; J'élis ma sépulture de mon corps en l'Eglise Notre Dame de Saignelégier. Je lègue à la dite église pour être absous perpétuellement la somme de 12 livres bâloises d'autant que le fief que je retiens de Monsieur de Bellelay est un fief mâle. Je veux qu'après mon décès mes biens aimés fils Siffrid, André et Franz en soient jouissants... Je lègue pour une fois à Alyson, ma fille naturelle, femme de Pierret Chièvre, bourgeois à Delémont la somme de 100 livres condition que son mari ne lui pourra ""despendre"", ni en payer dettes, mais seront icelles 100 livres pour la dite Alyson et ses pauvres enfants. Item je donne et lègue par prévention à mes biens aimés fils Siffrid André et Franz la juste moitié de mes biens, meubles et immeubles. Quant au reste de mes biens, je les donne à mes biens aimés enfants nommés: le révérend père Marx, jésuite, Siffrid, André, Franz, Elysol femme d'Henri Fusier d'Alle, Carine femme de Guillaume Varnier habitant à Delémont, Annelle ""..te"" ou veuve d'Adam Froidevaux du Cerneux Godat et Chrischonne. Je prie mon fils Marx d'autant qu'icelui est assuré de sa vie qu'après quelques paieux legs, il lui plaise d'instituer ses frères et sœurs pour ses vrais héritiers. Je reconnais aussi que mon fils Franz n'est habille à gouverner son bien, moins à tenir ménage de par soi, ni aussi à se marier pour pouvoir nourrir femme et enfants. Je désire pourvoir à ce que ledit Franz soit condignement nourri et entretenu sa vie naturelle durante. Je veux qu'il ait une pension annuelle de cent livres bâloises y compris aussi 100 livres la jouissance de son bien, nourri, chaussé, vestu et administré ses autres nécessités corporels auprès l'un de ses frères ou autre part en quel lieu qu'il plaira à messieurs les hauts officiers, lesquels je prie de bien vouloir s'en occuper. Après le décès de Franz, mes autres enfants en seront les vrais héritiers. Item attendu que mon fils André est à Rome ou autre part en Italie et que son retour est incertain, en tant qu'il ne retournera au Pays je veux et ordonne que mes autres enfants, excepté ledit Marx, soient ses héritiers par substitution comme audit Franz. Comme mes autres enfants ont déjà reçu quelques notables sommes ou autres biens, je veux et ordonne qu'en tel cas qu'ils fassent mes obsèques et droits funéraux en notre Sainte Église selon les bonnes institutions d'icelle. Et afin que mon testament soit valable, je prie Ludovic Matthey, Lieutenant Général en ladite Montagne des Bois, notaire public des Autorités apostolique et impérial, de bien vouloir rédiger ce mien présent testament.

Codicille de Richard Guenin, ancien maire en la Franche Montagne des Bois. 
Au nom de Dieu Notre seigneur, Amen! Je Richard Guenin ancien maire en la Franche Montagne des Bois, combien que je sois depuis quelques années en ça débile de mes membres, néanmoins sain de sens, mémoire et d’entendement, sachant que la volonté de l’homme est muable et changeable selon les occurrences jusqu’au dernier article de la mort. C’est pourquoi je fais savoir à tous que sur le 27 mai 1616, j’ai conduit mon testament nuncupatif. Or est-il que du temps de ma disposition dernière, mon très aimé fils André était en Italie au service d’illustrissime et révérendissime seigneur Cardinal de sainte Cécile à Rome, le retour et dessein duquel ne m’était aucunement assuré, néanmoins voyant que ma maladie et indisposition s’augmentait et s’aggravait de jour en autre, je cherchai tous les moyens pour le rappeler auprès de moi, lequel sur ma rescription m’étant venu me trouver avec la permission de son dit Seigneur le cardinal, avec promesse de retourner et étant mon dit fils au pays et m’ayant trouvé en ma faiblesse et débilité, a mieux aimé quitter son service, duquel il était entendant d’une bonne récompense, que de m’abandonner, partant postposant tout son bonheur. C’est pourquoi pour obvier à ce grand vice et perte d’ingratitude, je déclare que j’ajoute ceci à mon testament pour récompenser mon bien aimé fils André et aussi pour plus grande assurance des entretiens de mon fils Franz. Je donne donc à André l’héritage qui m’est échute après le décès d’Elisol, ma fille de son bien maternel, lequel je veux qu’il soit relevé sur ma maison et appartenance situées à Delémont. Je veux que ma dite maison et appartenance ensemble d’une oeulche et curtil après mon décès. 
Fait et passé à Saignelégier le 3 mai 1619.
